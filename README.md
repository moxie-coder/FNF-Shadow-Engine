# Friday Night Funkin' - Shadow Engine

A highly modified Psych Engine 0.7.3.

Ready to be source-modded.

## Differences Between The Original
- Uses our [Lime](https://github.com/HomuHomu833-haxelibs/lime) and [HXCPP](https://github.com/HomuHomu833-haxelibs/hxcpp) forks
- Uses latest Haxe
- Uses CNE FPS Counter and some code from [P-Slice](https://github.com/Psych-Slice/P-Slice), [Leather Engine (RIP)](https://github.com/Vortex2Oblivion/LeatherEngine) and [REDACTED]
- Mobile Support (duh)
- Applies OpenAL Soft Config For better audio
- Slightly more accurate FPS and less RAM Usage
- Some 0.6.3 compability
- Linux ARM support (FNF on Raspberry Pi baby)
- Kade Engine Results Screen
- PlayState has `changeNoteSkin` for easy in-game note skin changing
- Play as Opponent
- Stripped to only have Test song and some characters
- Kade Engine Note Timing (man I feel old), VSync and Pop Up Score Option
- Includes all classes as possible into source
